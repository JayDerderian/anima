NOTE: from the terminal, cd into the current anima directory and 
      enter pyuic5 -x mainWindow.ui -o mainWindow.py to generate
      python code from what I make in the QT designer software. 

NOTE: Turn this into a connection class that can work with whatever QT5 automatically
      generates once I make something there? Will need to include the click() function there
      maybe? This could be a series of wrappers that work with mainWindow.py, or possibly
      with multiple UI files. 

      from mainWindow import Ui_mainWindow as mw

This is some possible syntax for calling functions from create.py's generate 
class, as well as var.py. Other items like saving a newly created piece, 
the associated pretty_midi object, and basically any other thing I want to call.


call generative or variation function. 
whatever function you want. might need to
account for possible arguments required by the
generative functions.

def click(self):
    if(object.function(any args, modify click as needed for this?!) != -1):
        return True
    return False


this is the connection syntax used with mainWindow.py
once that's ready. put this in the setupUi function in 
the Ui

self.actionName.triggered.connect(lambda: self.clicked(<args>))
